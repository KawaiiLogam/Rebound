Rebound is a content mod for Terraria.
Currently only has prehardmode content.
I'm currently updating it for hardmode and further fleshing out the content in this mod. I want to add more serious classes as well but I highly value the uniqueness.
I also am trying to learn to write AI better so I can have unique bosses. I think bosses are the deciding factor for mods being good or not.

So far it adds:
-A new class: The Bouncier, who deals resilience damage by throwing bouncing balls. I don't care if you think it should be included in melee or throwing.
-A subclass: that hits bouncy balls with mallets
-A boss right before WoF
-A curse that you may have to cure yourself of
-Two new town npcs:
	-The Fortune Hunter
	-The School Girl
-A gachapon with 3 types of gacha throughout prehardmode as you beat bosses that include unique items, vanities, weapons, and other useful things
-A few swords
-A summoning weapon
-A yoyo
-A bunch of bouncy balls
-Four mallets

Bouncier:
As a bouncier you can choose to focus solely on throwing bouncy balls, focus on mallets, or do both. This class has two armor sets available so far, a potion, and
2 accessories dedicated to it.

The Fortune Hunter:
(Requires: Rubber Band Ball in inventory)
A pretty basic npc. Sells a unique sword she found in the desert. She also may come across a certain 'book' that contains a powerful curse. 

The School Girl:
(Requires: Ten silver in inventory)
A girl who likes to collect figures and toys. She can sell you 3 types of gachas but watch out. You could end up broke with nothing to your name other than some seaweed.
